### A note on changed listeners

Since most code is probably already type hinting events, the listener change is likely to not have an impact on your code. It's good to know though that you don't have to worry about certain naming conventions any more:

- In **aggregate roots**, you don't have to prefix apply methods with `apply` anymore if you don't want to
- In **projectors**, you don't need a manual mapping anymore, neither does the event variable need to be called `$event`
- In **reactors**, you don't need a manual mapping anymore, neither does the event variable need to be called `$event`
- **Event queries** are a new concept and work in the same way

Here's an example:

```php
class MyProjector extends Projector
{
    public function anEventHandlerWithAnotherName(MyEvent $eventVariableWithAnotherName): void
    {
        // This handler will automatically handle `MyEvent`
    }
}



```
Note that `__invoke` in projectors and reactors works the same way, it's automatically registered based on the type hinted event.

## 4.10.2 - 2021-05-04

- Add missing config key in config stub (#203)

## 4.10.1 - 2021-04-21

- Also store aggregate root version when one event is persisted

## 4.10.0 - 2021-04-21

- Deprecate `AggregateRoot::$allowConcurrency`
- Fix for race condition in aggregate roots (#170), you will need to run a migration to be able to use it:

```php
public function up()
{
    Schema::table('stored_events', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->unique(['aggregate_uuid', 'aggregate_version']);
    });
}



```
**Note**: if you run this migration, all aggregate roots using `$allowConcurrency` will not work any more.
